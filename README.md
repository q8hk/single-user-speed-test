# LibreSpeed

## Single-user speed test queue

This build uses a server-side FIFO queue so only one browser can run a bandwidth
test at a time. Waiting clients poll for their position, active clients renew a
45-second lease, and abandoned leases expire automatically.

The queue state is stored in the system temporary directory by default. Set
`SPEEDTEST_QUEUE_FILE` to an absolute path on shared storage when multiple
Apache/PHP instances serve the same speed-test backend.

Queue leases are random bearer tokens held only in browser memory and sent in
the `X-Speedtest-Queue-Token` header. They are not based on IP addresses or
cookies and are not placed in request URLs. The backend stores no names, raw IP
addresses, user agents, or speed-test results. Short-lived keyed hashes of
client IP addresses are used only to enforce join rate limits.

For multiple-point deployments, set `SPEEDTEST_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` on each backend
to a comma-separated list of exact frontend origins, for example
`https://speed.example.com`. Same-host origins are allowed automatically.
HTTPS is enforced except on localhost. If TLS terminates at a trusted reverse
proxy, set `SPEEDTEST_ASSUME_HTTPS=true`. For explicit local development only,
`SPEEDTEST_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=true` disables this check. The queue file is
created with mode `0600`; any custom queue-file parent directory should be
private to the web server account.

No Flash, No Java, No Websocket, No Bullshit.

This is a very lightweight speed test implemented in Javascript, using XMLHttpRequest and Web Workers.

## Server requirements

* A reasonably fast web server with Apache 2 (nginx, IIS also supported)
* PHP 5.4 or newer (other backends also available)
* MariaDB or MySQL database to store test results (optional, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL and SQLite also supported)
* A fast! internet connection

## Installation

Assuming you have PHP and a web server installed, the installation steps are quite simple.

1. Download the source code and extract it
1. Copy the project files to your web server's shared folder (ie. `/var/www/html/speedtest` for Apache). For the current layout, the web root should contain `index.html`, `index-classic.html`, `index-modern.html`, `stability.html`, `design-switch.js`, `config.json`, `speedtest.js`, `speedtest_worker.js`, `stability_worker.js`, `favicon.ico`, and the `backend` folder.
1. Also copy the contents of `frontend/` into the same web root so the modern UI assets end up in `styling/`, `javascript/`, `images/`, and `fonts/` next to the HTML files.
1. Optionally, copy the results folder too, and set up the database using the config file in it.
1. Be sure your permissions allow read and execute access where needed.
1. Visit YOURSITE/speedtest/index.html and voila!

### Installation Video

This video shows the installation process of a standalone LibreSpeed server: [Quick start installation guide for Debian 12](https://fdossena.com/?p=speedtest/quickstart_deb12.frag)

More videos will be added later.

## Android app

A template to build an Android client for your LibreSpeed installation is available [here](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-android).

## CLI client

A command line client is available [here](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-cli).

## .NET client

A .NET client library is available in the [`LibreSpeed.NET`](https://github.com/Memphizzz/LibreSpeed.NET) repo ([NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibreSpeed.NET)), maintained by [MemphiZ](https://github.com/Memphizzz).

## Development

If you want to contribute or develop with LibreSpeed, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for information about using npm for development tasks, linting, and formatting.

## Design switch

LibreSpeed supports both the classic and modern UI. The root `index.html` acts as a lightweight switcher and redirects to `index-classic.html` or `index-modern.html` based on `config.json` (`useNewDesign`) or URL overrides (`?design=new` / `?design=old`). For architecture and deployment details (including Docker behavior), see [DESIGN_SWITCH.md](DESIGN_SWITCH.md).

## Stability test

LibreSpeed includes a standalone connection stability test at `stability.html`, linked from both the classic and modern interfaces. It repeatedly measures ping over a selected duration and reports current, average, minimum, maximum, jitter, and failed request percentage values with a live chart.

The stability test can target the local LibreSpeed backend, one of the configured multiple points of test, or built-in external targets such as Google, Cloudflare, and Apple. It also supports optional latency threshold alerts and CSV export of the collected samples. Docker deployments copy `stability.html` and `stability_worker.js` into the web root and reuse the same server list configuration as the main UI.

## Docker

A docker image is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest/pkgs/container/speedtest), check our [docker documentation](doc_docker.md) for more info about it.
The image is built every week to include an updated version of the ipinfo-DB used for ISP detection. Also this ensures, that the latest security patches in PHP are installed. Therefore we recommend to use the `latest` image.

## Go backend

A Go implementation is available in the [`speedtest-go`](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-go) repo, maintained by [Maddie Zhan](https://github.com/maddie).

## Rust backend

A Rust implementation is available in the [`speedtest-rust`](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-rust) repo, maintained by [Sudo Dios](https://github.com/sudodios).

## Node.js backend

A partial Node.js implementation is available in the `node` branch, developed by [dunklesToast](https://github.com/dunklesToast). It's not recommended to use at the moment.
